Project: https://github.com/prso/hexcurse-ng

This is a fork from [LonnyGomes/hexcurse](https://github.com/LonnyGomes/hexcurse) with fixes and improvements.

Description
-----------
Hexcurse is a curses-based hex editing utility that can open, edit, and save
files and block devices, editing both the hexadecimal and decimal values.

It was written by Lonny Gomes and James Stephenson but they haven't
maintained it for some time.

It currently supports fast searching, hex and decimal address output,
jumping to specified locations in the file, "undo" capabilities, "bolded"
modifications, colors, EBCDIC mode, and quick keyboard and mouse shortcuts to
commands.


Requirements
------------
You must have the ncurses development libraries (version 5+) to compile this program


Installation
------------

    make
    make install
